# Hybrid-AI-FEA-Framework-for-Rapid-Shear-Strength-Prediction
Hybrid AI-FEA framework for rapid, accurate shear-strength prediction in cold backward-extruded Al6061/SiC composites. Combines FEA &amp; experimental data with ML surrogates (Random Forest, MLP, stacking) and generates publication-quality plots and evaluation metrics.
